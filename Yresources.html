      <div class="pageIntro">🌿 Placeholder Description for the Resources Library
        This library will become a central hub for all supporting materials collected throughout the workbook.
        It will store resources such as articles, videos, tools, accessibility notes, sustainability guidance, and other reference material that appears across multiple modules. The goal is to create a searchable, organised space where related knowledge can be browsed, tagged, and revisited independently of individual modules. As the workbook grows, this library will act as a long‑term knowledge base that complements the learning modules and helps connect ideas across topics.

      <div class="futureVision">
        <p>🌿 How the flow works (your vision, clarified)
        1. User works through a module (e.g., Tables)
        Inside the module, they have:
        - Key Facts → their own concise bullet notes
        - Exercises → practice
        - Accessibility Notes → what they learned about making tables accessible
        - Sustainability Notes → what they learned about making tables efficient/maintainable
        These notes are personal, not pre‑written.
        2. When they write Accessibility or Sustainability notes…
        Those notes are:
        - saved inside the module (so they stay contextual)
        - also duplicated into the Library under the relevant category
        So the Tables module might add:
        - “Use <caption> to describe table purpose” → Accessibility Library
        - “Avoid layout tables to reduce maintenance overhead” → Sustainability Library
        3. The Library becomes a searchable knowledge base
        The sidebar has tabs like:
        - Accessibility
        - Sustainability
        - Resources
        - (maybe later: Performance, UX, etc.)
        Inside each tab is a searchable list of all notes the user has ever written, across all modules.
        Searching “tables” would show:
        - Accessibility notes tagged “tables”
        - Sustainability notes tagged “tables”
        - Any resources tagged “tables”
        Searching “accessibility” would show:
        - All accessibility notes from all modules
        - All resources tagged accessibility
        4. Modules and Library stay in sync
        Modules = where you learn and write
        Library = where you store and retrieve
        This is exactly how a real personal knowledge system works (like Obsidian, Notion, or Zettelkasten), but in a lightweight, custom way.

        🌱 Why this is a brilliant design
        It gives you:
        - Contextual learning (notes live inside modules)
        - Global retrieval (notes also live in the library)
        - Searchability (find anything by keyword)
        - Tagging (module name becomes a tag)
        - Cross‑topic insight (see patterns across modules)
        - Future‑proofing (easy to expand later)
        And it fits your plant metaphor beautifully:
        - Modules = where seeds are planted
        - Library = where the garden grows and connects

        🌼 What this means technically (simple version)
        You don’t need to build the full system now.
        But the architecture is clear:
        When the user writes a note in a module:
        - Save it to that module’s data object
        - Also push it into a global array like:
        accessibilityNotes.push({
          text: "Use <caption> to describe table purpose",
          module: "Tables",
          tags: ["tables", "accessibility", "html"]
        });


        Later, the Library page:
        - loads all notes
        - filters by category
        - filters by search input
        - displays results
            This is very achievable with fundamentals.</p>
