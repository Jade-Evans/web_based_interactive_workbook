# Project Description
The goal for this project is to build a flexible, web‑based interactive workbook that supports and documents my development as a software engineer. It provides a structured space to track progress, practise concepts, and reinforce understanding through explanations written in my own words.
Each module includes key facts, worked examples, accessibility notes, and areas for personal practice. While the content currently follows The Odin Project’s Full Stack JavaScript curriculum, the structure is designed to grow with me as I explore new topics and create my own exercises. The project is actively evolving as I continue to refine the layout, add new modules, and expand the interactive features.
Future development plans include making the workbook more interactive and reusable — allowing users to add their own modules, enter notes, choose display preferences, and save their data directly in the browser using localStorage, without needing to edit the HTML. This will help transform the workbook from a personal learning tool into a more general, customisable platform for independent study.
By combining clear documentation, practical examples, and user‑input elements, this workbook acts as both a learning tool and a growing record of my independent study, problem‑solving approach, and commitment to accessible, well‑structured web development.

## Project Evolution (Short Summary)
1. Static HTML Pages →
Individual .html files for each module. Fully manual, duplicated structure, hard to maintain.
2. Reusable Module Template →
One template + modules.js for content. Cleaner, scalable, but still rigid with fixed sections.
3. Fluid Block‑Based Canvas →
A blank workspace where users add blocks (notes, code, images, etc.). Fully flexible, future‑proof, user‑driven.


# Tech Stack
- HTML5 – semantic structure
- CSS3 – styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES6+) – interactivity and logic
- VS Code – primary editor
- Live Server – local development preview
- Browser DevTools – debugging and inspection
- WSL2 (Ubuntu) – Linux‑based development environment
- Node.js – development tooling and environment support



# Intended Features
- Structured learning modules with key facts, explanations, and worked examples
- Practice exercises to reinforce concepts through hands‑on implementation
- Accessibility notes to build strong, inclusive development habits
- Progress tracking using dropdown selectors and date markers
- Consistent page layout for clarity and ease of navigation
- Expandable design that supports adding new modules and topics
- Future interactivity planned through user‑generated modules, notes, and preferences saved via localStorage
