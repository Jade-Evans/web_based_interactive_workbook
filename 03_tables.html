      <li>Tables are useful for displaying and representing relationships in <strong>tabular data (data in rows and columns)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Tables <strong>should not</strong> be used for layouts, for the following reasons:
        <ol>
          <li>Table markup is more complex than layout markup; when the tags are read out by screen readers
            this causes confusion and <strong>limits accessibility</strong>. The added complexity also means more difficulty with writing, debugging and maintaining 
            code than required with dedicated layout techniques. 
          </li>
          <li>Proper layout containers such as header or div default to 100% of parent, making them automatically responsive. 
            However, the width of tables defaults to their content, so it takes more effort to make tables define page layouts correctly.
